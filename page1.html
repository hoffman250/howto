				Google's map application is one of the most popular applications out there. It is one that I use on my phone and laptop quite often so I was very interested in learning how to work with its API. As one would expect, Google's documentation is quite good; however, to a novice such as myself, learning how to actually talk to google through their API was/is a pretty steep learning curve.

				While the documentation for Google Maps is very thorough,the downside is that the documentation is also vast and it can be a little intimidating trying to find your way around. Google has development guides for web, web services, ios and android. They have free plans and paid plans. They also have map APIs available for coders and non-coders alike. Since we are coders and our focus has mainly been developing in Javascript, this is the area of the Google Maps API where we will focus. A link to the starting point of this API can be found here:

				This will take you to a page that looks like this...
